# Terminal Access to Virtual Machines

![](images/terminal-window.png)

SSH Terminal access allows a user to connect and interact with a virtual machine from a terminal window.

There are a couple of virtual machine (VM) requirements for SSH terminal access:

- Hypervisor integration tools.
- A running SSH server.

## Installation

1. **For VMs hosted on Hyper-V**
    - Refer to the [Microsoft Linux support information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/supported-linux-and-freebsd-virtual-machines-for-hyper-v-on-windows) to see if a distribution is supported on Hyper-V and instructions on installing any additional integration components
        - Network information needs to be communicated over the VMBus via Hyper-V integration services, currently RedHat, CentOS, FreeBSD, and most Debian distributions support this
        - Kali Linux does not support VM integration components


1.  **For VMs hosted on ESX**

    - Linux VMs must support the open-vm-tools package. On most builds, this is installed by default. It is recommended to verify this is installed using the following commands: 
        - On **Debian/Ubuntu** builds this can be installed with ```sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools```.
        - On **RHEL or CENTOS** ```sudo yum install open-vm-tools -y```.

## Configure networking

- Generally, Linux VMs need to be set to automatically bring online a new network adapter at boot and pull an address via DHCP. Most Linux distributions name adapters eth**X** where X is the number of adapters starting from 0.

- If the VM is unable to connect to the internet after enabling terminal access, you may need to disable the default route assigned to the new adapter. The SSH network has no routing capabilities.

### RedHat/CentOS
- Create a configuration file at /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth**X**, where X is equal to the number of adapters your VM has. It should be set to automatically start at boot and pull an address via DHCP.
    
    - Sample Configuration:

    ```linenums
    TYPE=Ethernet
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    NAME=eth1
    ONBOOT=yes
    ```

### Debian/Ubuntu

Depending on your distribution, you will need to use one of two methods to add a new network adapter: 

1. Using /etc/network/interfaces. This is based on the ifupdown package, which has been superseded by a new default method (Netplan) that uses either the Network Manager or Systemd-netorkd renderers. 
2. Using [Netplan](https://netplan.io/"Netplan) YAML configuration files. The Netplan YAML file contains a description of the network interfaces and their respective configurations. 

- To add a network interface using a distribution configured to use the ifupdown package, open /etc/network/interfaces and add an entry for eth**X** where X is equal to the number of adapters your VM has. It should be set to automatically start at boot and pull DHCP information.
    - Sample Configuration:

    ```linenums
    auto eth1
    allow-hotplug eth1
    iface eth1 inet dhcp
    ```
- To add a network interface using a distribution configured to use Netplan YAML files,
    - Go to /etc/netplan, and, using an editor of your choice, open the \*-config.yaml (the name will vary) file used to create the network configuration.
    - Under the ethernets node, add an adapter and configure it to use DHCP, as shown in the sample below:
    
        - Sample YAML File, showing a static IP and DHCP configuration:
        
        ```
        networks
          ethernets:
            ens32:
              addresses:
              - 192.168.1.1.21/24
              gateway4: 192.168.1.1
              nameservers:
              - 192.168.1.2
              search:
              - hexelo.com
            ens33:
              dhcp4: true
          version 2
          ```
          
    >[!alert] Please note that YAML files are sensitive to whitespace and indentation. Do not use the tab key to indent items: always use the space bar.
    - After making the changes to the YAML file, run the command `sudo netplan apply`.
    
    

## Configure a running SSH server

SSH configuration may need to be modified to enable password authentication or root login.

1. Open ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config``` and uncomment the line **_PasswordAuthentication yes_**. 

1. If you need root login as well, uncomment **_PermitRootLogin yes_**, or add the line if you canâ€™t find it. 

1. Uncomment the line **_UseDNS yes_** and change it to **_UseDNS no_**, or add the line if you can't find it. This disables a reverse DNS lookup on terminal connect that can cause a 10 second delay.

1. Disable the networkmanager-wait or the networkd-wait service if applicable. This service can result in a 20 second boot delay when using NICs set to DHCP. On most versions of Linux this can be done via the following command: ```sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service``` or ```sudo systemctl mask systemd-networkd-wait-online.service```. 

    >[!alert] On recent versions of Ubuntu, you may get unpredicatable results by disabling the network manager or the networkd service (`systemd-networkd-wait-online.service`). As an alternative, you can mask the service by using the command ```sudo systemctl mask systemd-networkd-wait-online.service``` or ```sudo systemctl mask NetworkManager-wait-online.service```, depending on which is applicable. The `systemctl mask` command is very powerful and should be used carefully. However, before disabling or masking these services, you shold verify whether, in fact, you need to make this configuration change. When booting the VM, watch to see whether the boot processes pauses for any reason during the network configuration. If it doesn't pause, or the pause is only a few seconds, you do not need to take any action.

1. Make sure the SSH service auto boots. On most versions of linux can be done by entering the following command: ```sudo systemctl enable ssh```.

1. Start the service with the following command: ```sudo systemctl startssh```.

1. Once this is done, capture a differencing disk. 

1. In LOD, edit the lab profile and on the **Virtual Machines tab**, check the **_Connect to terminal_** checkbox for the VM you performed the above steps on.

1. Launch a new instance of your lab profile and verify the VM connects via SSH. The VM should boot to a terminal window.
